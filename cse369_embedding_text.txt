Course Goals
This course introduces students to the basic components and
          techniques that underpin digital circuits, starting from logic
          gates and building towards larger building blocks such as adders and
          finite state machines (FSMs).
          This course emphasizes simulation in SystemVerilog and implementation
          on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

          This is the introductory course for computer engineering;
