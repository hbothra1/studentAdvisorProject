Course Goals¶

Learning Objectives¶
CSE 122is designed around a set of 17 learning objectives, organized into seven major themes. At the end of the course, successful students will be able to do the following:
Computational Thinking
Decompose a problem into smaller subproblems that can be composed to give a solution to the full problem
Create an algorithm to solve a given problem and express that algorithm in a structured way (e.g. pseudocode)
Code Comprehension
Trace the behavior and state of a Java program that includes complex and/or compound data through its execution
Predict the behavior and results of executing a Java program that includes complex and/or compound data
Code Writing
Write functionally correct Java programs that meet a provided specification using objects and compound data types
Write programs that accept input and produce output to/from the console and text files
Select and apply appropriate data structures to manage and manipulate data for a given problem:ListsStacksQueuesMaps
Lists
Stacks
Queues
Maps
Write functionally correct Java classes to represent new, compound data types
Define relationships between Java classes using interfaces and references
Write programs and classes that are readable and maintainable, and that conform to provided guidelines for style and implementation
Communication
Clearly and effectively describe the behavior of a Java program that uses other classes
Clearly and effectively describe the behavior of a Java class and its public methods for various inputs and state
Produce clear and effective documentation to improve comprehension and maintainability of programs, methods, and classes
Testing
Determine the correctness of a program by evaluating its behavior as compared to a provided specification
Identify and enumerate a set of inputs or tests that are sufficient to determine the correctness of a program or class
Debugging
Identify errors in a program’s state or behavior
Define and implement fixes for identified errors
Ethics/Impact
Describe ethical and sociotechnical issues related to software and technology and explain how their choices as programmers can impact those issues.
