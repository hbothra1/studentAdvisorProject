In-Person Learning
Your participation is required because this is a discussion seminar.
It does not make sense to record a seminar like this, nor do we plan
to support hybrid learning unless there is a situation like a
public-health outbreak such that we have no better option.  It is not
feasible to support asynchronous participation in a discussion
seminar.
The health and safety of you and your classmates, is, of course, a
primary concern.  If you need to miss class due to illness or other
hardship, you should do so, but do save absences for unavoidable
circumstances due to the grading criteria below.
