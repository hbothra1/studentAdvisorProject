CSE 421: Introduction to Algorithms, Autumn 2024

Course Goals
Model word problems as computational problems.
Determine an appropriate algorithm design paradigm for a new problem.
Design an algorithm using a variety of algorithm-design paradigms (including greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, flow modeling, and others).
Prove that your algorithm produces the correct answer.
Reduce between a known problem and a new problem (for showing hardness or for reusing existing algorithms)
Identify and cope with computational problems that are infeasible.
Consider the implications of modeling decisions in the real world.
