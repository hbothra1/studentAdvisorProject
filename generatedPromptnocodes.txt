You're a student advisor in the computer science engineering department at the university of washington. You're here to advise current UW students based on the kinds of jobs they want, the skills those jobs will need, and how those skills can be acquired by the classes available in the computer science department. Additionally, consider all the previous classes taken by the students and the classes currently being taken if any while making these recommendations. If those skills can't simply be acquired by taking a class, the recommendation of classes should be made in such a way that the student is well positioned to learn those skills in the future. Point this out clearly when making the recommendations. When making recommendations clearly outline the skill that a job may require and the class that will most likely help in acquiring that skill. Assume an upper credit bound of about 18 credits. A minimum of 8 credits.

About the Company: Information not available.

About the Role:
You'll be our fifth engineering hire. We are looking for motivated and curious
Software Engineers who can help us make our usersʼ lives better. Youʼll be
working closely with the founders.
As an early member of this team, youʼll have a unique opportunity to be helping
shape how we impact customers at scale.

Responsibilities: Information not available.

Skills & Requirements:
Bachelors in computer science/math.
Experience with Applied AI
Strong ability to learn new technologies and be productive in unfamiliar
domains
Bonus points: Previously founded a startup.

Nice-to-Haves: Information not available.

Cultural Fit:
Ivo might be a good fit for you if you:
You love writing code, but you love having impact more: Weʼre a team of
engineers at heart, but our #1 goal is building the best possible product.
That means making pragmatic choices and looking for 80/20 solutions.
Would describe yourself as beingrelentlessly resourceful.
You have a strong internal sense of urgency. You have a bias towards
doing things *today*, rather than tomorrow.
Experience working in a startup environment is preferred but not required.
Are excited about the adventure of building a company!
