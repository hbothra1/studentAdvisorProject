Create an algorithm to solve a given problem and express that algorithm in a structured way (e.g. pseudocode)
Trace and predict the behavior and results of Java code that uses basic control structures and data abstractions
Write functionally correct and maintainable Java code using basic control structures, primitive data types, and basic data abstractions that meets a provided specification and conforms to provided guidelines for style and implementation
Clearly and effectively describe and document the behavior of Java code
Identify and enumerate a set of inputs or tests to determine the correctness of a Java program
Identify and fix errors in Java code
Describe the ethical and social impacts of technology and explain how our choices as programmers can influence these impacts
