Learning Reflections (weekly)
Deadline: 11:59pm every Friday
To aid your process of learning in this course, we will ask you to build up your own reference sheet for each week so that you can better look back at what you learned each week. More details on what you should turn in can be foundhere, but it is meant to be a low-stakes form of staying on top of the course. What we ask you to turn in is rather narrow in scope in the scope of your learning, so you are encouraged to keep other notes or reference materials outside of what we ask you to turn in!
You will submit learning reflections onGradescope.

Learning Reflections
You cannot use late days on learning reflections. However you can turn them in up to a week after their due date for 50% credit (Except Final Learning Reflection).
