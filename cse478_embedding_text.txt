Overview
CSE 478 is a project- and discussion-based introduction to robotics. Autonomous vehicles will be used as a running example to introduce the algorithmic building blocks of robotics, and students will use theMuSHRrally car platform to gain hands-on experience. Students will learn the fundamentals of robots, as well as some cutting edge topics including machine learning applications in robotics. Moreover, students will also develop the skills required to read fundamental research papers and discuss the pros and cons of these research papers critically. By the end of this course, students should be able to:
Identify fundamental abstractions used by mobile robots in the wild (localization, planning, control), explain how they interact, and analyze algorithmic trade-offs within each abstraction.
Implement the above abstractions to enable a simulated mobile robot to navigate safely and efficiently, using Python and the Robot Operating System (ROS). Conduct principled robot experiments to diagnose and fix bugs across the mobile robot software stack. Implement and validate the software stack on a real hardware platform.
Be able to read, critique and absorb content in cutting edge research papers in robotics.
