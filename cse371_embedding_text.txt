Course Goals
This course provides a theoretical background in, and practical
          experience with, tools and techniques for modeling complex digital
          systems with the SystemVerilog hardware description language,
          including converting software algorithms to hardware.
          Prerequisites: EE 205/215 and EE 271/CSE 369.
