Course Overview

Course Description
This course provides an introduction to human-computer interaction and the design process.
Students will learn methods and skills for designing and prototyping interactive systems.
The course covers a design process from the initial formulation of a design problem to creation of digital prototypes.
Importantly, the course does not emphasize development but instead fully focuses on design.
The course structure is a mix of lectures, hands-on activities, and design critiques by peers and course staff.
The course is overwhelmingly organized around a group project, in which students:
Ideate and Propose Design Problems
Study Existing Practices and Challenges
Explore Potential Design Opportunities and Tradeoffs
Evaluate and Iterate Upon a Design
Communicate a Problem and Resulting Design

Learning Objectives
Process-Focused Perspective on Interaction Design
Design Research Methods and Skills
Task-Focused Scenario Development, Sketching, and Storyboarding
Rapid Prototyping and Iteration
Critical Perspective on Design Solutions
